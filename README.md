<!-- ABOUT ME -->
## 🙋‍♀️ About Me

Hello! I'm Elaine, a passionate learner currently pursuing Backend Web Development through the **ALX program**. My fascination with technology stems from the way it connects people, tells stories, and builds bridges across communities.

I'm deeply inspired by the positive impact software engineering can have on society, and I'm excited to be a part of that movement—writing code not just for machines, but for meaningful change.

### 🌟 My Goals:
- 🧠 Become a well-rounded expert in backend software engineering
- 🌍 Use technology as a bridge between communities
- 🚀 Build impactful, real-world solutions with clean, scalable code
